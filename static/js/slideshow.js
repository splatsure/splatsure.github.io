/* ---- Slideshow: cyclic peeking carousel with arrows and dots ----
 *
 * Replaces bulma-carousel, which needed jQuery and 40 KB of library to do this.
 * The active slide is centred with its neighbours peeking in at either edge, so
 * a viewer can see there is more to the set without a caption saying so.
 *
 * The set is a true ring. Each slide is positioned by its *cyclic* distance from
 * the active one, so the slide before the first is the last and the slide after
 * the last is the first — and every move, including last-to-first, animates as
 * one smooth step. An earlier version cloned the end slides and snapped across
 * the seam, which read as a jump whenever the wrap was crossed.
 *
 * Draggable by mouse and touch alike. Deliberately no auto-advance: these are
 * research results, and yanking one away mid-inspection is worse than a click.
